# slush-angular-pack 

> Slush generator to scaffold out angular + webpack apps written in ES6


## Getting Started

Welcome to the Angular and Webpack generator for Slush. Slush-Angular-Pack will scaffold out an Angular application with webpack. It follows the latest Angular architecture organization standards. 

### Prerequisites
As with any Slush generator, you will need to have **Node** and **Slush** installed globally.

Install `slush` globally:

```bash
$ npm install -g slush
```
After you have all the prerequisites installed, install the **Slush-Angular-Pack** generator globally. 

Install `slush-angular-pack` globally:

```bash
$ npm install -g slush-angular-pack
```

### Usage

Create a new folder for your project:

```bash
$ mkdir my-project
```

Run the generator from within the new folder:

```bash
$ cd my-project 
$ slush angular-pack
```

There are some basic scaffolding questions to help get your application built out. During the scaffolding process, it will install all node modules. 

Once you are ready to start developing, you can run the application in develop mode with the following npm script run:
```bash
$ npm run develop
```

## Getting To Know Slush

Slush is a tool that uses Gulp for project scaffolding.

Slush does not contain anything "out of the box", except the ability to locate installed slush generators and to run them with liftoff.
